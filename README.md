## Introduction:
The terms "Internet of Things" and "Internet of Everything" allude to the new trend of using small, inexpensive, and always-connected devices to communicate data to backend cloud-based applications. This opens up a whole new world of possibilities and products for businesses to develop and sell in both the industrial and consumer markets. One of the most common uses of an IoT gadget is to listen to bluetooth music through a speaker.
Ericsson designed Bluetooth to allow users of wireless headphones to connect to a variety of devices. We can now use Bluetooth to connect to almost any electronic item, including speakers, headphones, car stereo systems, wearables, game controllers, printers, medical equipment, and more. Bluetooth technology has progressed from basic Bluetooth to smart Bluetooth, with the most recent version being Bluetooth 5. Bluetooth 5, for example, has four times the range, double the speed, and an 800% increase in data transmission frequency.
